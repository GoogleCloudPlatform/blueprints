# What is this?
* `3p/main.go` is a utility program to filter out and categorize all licenses from a go module's vendor directory, in order to include them in the distributable to comply with 3rd party licensing requirements.
* `get_license.sh` will fetch and unpack an image to your local filesystem in order to inspect it to demonstrate proof during a Google launch that licensing requirements are being met
