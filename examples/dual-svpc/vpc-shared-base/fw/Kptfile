    Common firewall rules for projects with a private network.

    Included rules:

    - allow common ports between private IP ranges
    - allow common ports from GCP load balancer ranges
    - allow ssh and rdp from GCP IAP ranges

    Contents:
    -   egress
        -   allow-google-apis.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allows traffic
            to private.googleapis.com IP range
        -   allow-windows-kms.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allows traffic
            to kms.windows.googlecloud.com IP range
        -   deny-all.yaml - creates a firewall rule that denys all egress traffic
            on TCP/UDP. It is recommended that if this rule is enabled, to also
            enable the "allow-google-apis" rule.
    -   ingress
        -   allow-gcp-lb.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allows traffic from
            GCP load balancer ranges for health check and proxy traffic on ports
            80, 443, and 8080
        -   allow-iap-rdp.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allow traffic from
            IAP forwarding ranges for RDP
        -   allow-iap-ssh.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allow traffic from
            IAP forwarding ranges for SSH
        -   allow-internal-common.yaml - creates a firewall rule that allows SSH,
            SSL, HTTP (8080), and ICMP traffic on all RFC1918 ranges
