# DNS blueprint

This package contains a collection blueprints for creating [managed zones](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones) and [record sets](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/records) in those managed zones.

Creation of DNS resources requires **roles/dns.admin**
which can be granted at the org or project level.
